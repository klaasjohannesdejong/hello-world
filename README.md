# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.
My name is Klaas. I'm from the netherlands, i am 29 years old, and have been a manual labourer since i left school when i was 16 years old.
Recently i realised this is not the life i want to live the rest of my life.
When i used to be a kid, learning was quite easy, but the school enviornment wasn't that easy for me.
That's why i wanted to leave school as soon as i could and start working.
Now i'm slowly growing older i want to get back at using my brains. That's the reason i started doing the "software engineering" course on coursera (if there's better courses, please let me know).
My plan is to get an online job in the Artificial Intelligence field in around 5 years (hopefully sooner), and quit working as a manual labourer, since it's very demanding on the body.
I'm new to GitHub and i'm trying to expand my knowledge and connections so that it will help my learning journey in the coming years.
If you read this, feel free the send me a message and hopefully we can help and learn from each other.

greetings, Klaas de Jong
